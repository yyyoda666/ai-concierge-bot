# Components

React components organized by feature/domain.

## Structure

```
components/
├── chat/           # Chat-related components
│   └── ChatWidget.js
├── ui/             # Reusable UI components (future)
└── forms/          # Form components (future)
```

## Guidelines

- Components should be grouped by feature domain
- Keep related components together
- Use descriptive folder names
- Each component should have a clear, single responsibility
