2# Intelligence Matters - AI Chat Interface

## Project Brief

**Company:** Intelligence Matters (intelligencematters.se) - A creative AI agency positioned as a "Creative AI Operating System"

**Problem:** Currently prospects have to email Jacob directly (jacob@intelligencematters.se), which creates friction and doesn't provide structured data about incoming leads.

**Solution:** Replace email contact with an intelligent chat interface that handles both casual inquiries and structured brief submissions.

## What We're Building

### Chat Interface Goals
- **Dual-track conversations:** Handle both browsing ("what's possible?") and serious project inquiries
- **Progressive disclosure:** Natural conversation flow that builds comprehensive briefs without feeling like interrogation
- **Smart contact collection:** Intelligent timing for collecting contact details when prospects show genuine interest
- **Active brief consultation:** AI that helps prospects build better project specifications through targeted questions
- **Sophisticated personality:** French maître d' character - refined, helpful, subtly opinionated about quality

### Service Categories (for brief classification)
- **Production** - Final asset creation: ecom photography, editorials, product placement
- **Concepts** - Creative process work: moodboards, concepts, previews  
- **Labs** - Exploratory AI applications and workflow products

### Current Brief Structure (Enhanced)
```
Core Contact Fields:
- contactName, contactEmail, contactCompany, contactTitle

Request Classification:

## Design Philosophy

The chat should feel like talking to a sophisticated creative consultant at a high-end agency. Think French maître d' at a Michelin-starred restaurant combined with a top-tier creative director - someone who knows exactly what questions to ask to build the perfect brief, guides you through the process naturally, and makes the entire experience feel premium and valuable.

The progressive disclosure approach means prospects never feel like they're filling out a form - instead, they're having an intelligent conversation that happens to capture all the information needed for a comprehensive project brief.

## Team Context

- This replaces the current "email jacob@" approach with intelligent lead qualification
- Enhanced briefs enable better project scoping and more accurate quotes
- Progressive disclosure creates higher-quality leads with richer context
- Automation-ready data structure enables seamless workflow integration
- Post-submission experience allows for brief refinement and additional project discussions
- System designed to reflect Intelligence Matters' premium positioning and sophisticated approach
