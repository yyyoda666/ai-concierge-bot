# Intelligence Matters - Chatbot Development Reference

**Context for Development:** This document defines Intelligence Matters, a creative AI agency that delivers high-end commercial imagery using AI instead of traditional photography/production. This reference provides the strategic framework, target audience definitions, and service structure needed to configure an intelligent chat interface that will replace email-based client inquiries with conversational brief collection and qualification.

## Core Positioning

### What Intelligence Matters Does
Intelligence Matters executes **normal commercial creative work using AI instead of traditional production methods**. We deliver the same high-end imagery that brands like Prada expect, but without the cost, time, and logistical complexity of traditional photography, modeling, and studio work.

**Key Message:** We are **not** creating "AI art" or fantastical imagery. We execute familiar commercial scenarios—ecom photography, editorial shoots, campaign imagery—using AI as the production method rather than photographers, models, and studios.

## Target Audience Segments

### 1. High-End Established Brands (Prada, etc.)
- Require imagery that meets sophisticated aesthetic standards
- Need consistency and precision in visual execution
- May be skeptical of AI capabilities (thinking "AI = weird fantasy art")
- Work with substantial budgets for traditional production methods

### 2. Aspirational Brands
- Want to achieve high-end aesthetic levels but lack traditional production budgets
- Clear entry-level customers seeking premium results at accessible pricing

### 3. Edge-Pushing Innovators (SSENSE, etc.)
- Already operating at highest aesthetic levels but want to push further
- Interested in experimental applications (personalized models, customer-as-model imagery, cutting-edge visual concepts)

## Service Levels

### Concepts
**Scope:** Creative development from initial idea through pre-production  
**Timeline:** Early ideation to execution-ready briefs  
**Content Format:** Customer cases (since each creative journey is unique)  
**Business Model:** Stage-based creative consulting  

**Examples:**
- Napkin sketch → polished moodboard/presentation for team pitching
- Concept development → detailed storyboard with styling, angles, models, camera setups specified for production team

### Production
**Scope:** Final asset creation and delivery  
**Timeline:** Brief to finished imagery  
**Content Format:** Recipes (concrete input/output scenarios)  
**Business Model:** Project-based, likely per-image pricing with defined iteration limits  
**Note:** Most natural entry point for new clients

### Labs
**Scope:** Process innovation and systematic solutions  
**Content Format:** Examples across three types  

**Three Types:**
1. **Experimental R&D:** "Not sure if this is possible, but we'll experiment for research fees" (Retainer-based partnership)
2. **Workflow Systems:** Recurring production needs automated into streamlined processes (High upfront + management retainer, requires creative oversight)
3. **Complete Products:** Standalone applications or tools (Development investment + maintenance fees, operates independently)

---

## Client Journey & Pricing Logic

### Sequential Flow
**Production** (entry point) → **Concepts** (when brief isn't ready) → **Labs** (for ongoing systematic needs)

### Pricing Approaches
- **Production:** Project-based, likely per-image pricing with defined iteration limits
- **Concepts:** Consultation-based, stage-dependent
- **Labs:** Either retainer partnership or product development investment

## Chat Interface Strategy

### Objective
Replace "email jacob@intelligencematters.se" with intelligent chat that handles:
- General inquiries ("what's possible?")
- Serious project brief submissions
- Natural data collection through conversation
- Guided brief submission leading to structured forms

### Key Chat Behaviors
- **Dual-track conversations:** Casual browsing vs serious project inquiries
- **Natural data collection:** Conversational interface that captures structured form data
- **Value demonstration:** Qualified briefs receive free custom demo work
- **Clear positioning:** Combat "pink unicorns" AI perception with concrete commercial examples

### Content Architecture for Chat
1. **Production Recipes:** Simple input/output templates for each audience segment
2. **Concept Cases:** Examples of creative development stages and interventions  
3. **Labs Examples:** All three types with clear business model explanations
4. **Forms:** Structured data collection requirements for each service level

## Strategic Context

### Within Haegg Haegg Group
Intelligence Matters is the **profitable, proven business** while other group initiatives remain experimental/visionary. IM maintains sophisticated language appropriate for high-end clients while being clear about practical deliverables.

### Market Position
Perfectly positioned as traditional creative markets wake up to AI possibilities, but before DIY tools become sophisticated enough to threaten professional-level taste and technical mastery.

## Development Notes

### Content Approach
- **Living Document:** Start with basic scenarios, add complexity as offerings develop
- **Service-Level Organization:** Recipes for Production, Cases for Concepts, Examples for Labs
- **Audience Segmentation:** Different messaging/examples for each target segment
- **Clear Boundaries:** Avoid confusion with other Haegg Haegg initiatives

### Forms Architecture
- Each service level requires different data collection
- Chat should categorize inquiries behind the scenes
- Natural conversation flow that opportunistically captures structured data
- Preview and submission workflow for team qualification
