There are several approaches we could take to help you with this:\n\n1. AI Dress-up Solutions:\n- Tools like Dressx or VStitcher can help map clothing onto digital models\n- Some platforms allow you to use your actual product photos to create realistic 3D renders\n\n2. Virtual Model Options:\n- We could use standard e-commerce models or create custom ones\n- You can choose different body types/sizes to show size inclusivity\n\nBefore I provide more specific recommendations, it would help to know:\n- How many clothing items do you need to showcase?\n- Are these flat-lay photos or photos on hangers?\n- Do you have a specific style or look you want for the models?\n\nWould you like me to explain more about any of these options?"

Their shots often feature interesting angles and that perfect balance between fashion-forward and commercial appeal.\n\nWould you be able to share your product photo? You can submit it through our brief form at intelligencematters.se, or what would be easiest for you? We'll want to ensure the input image is high quality enough to achieve that premium look you're after.\n\nAlso, do you have any specific preferences for the model's styling (minimal, layered, etc.) or the overall mood (studio, urban, etc.)?"
