The styling is complemented by statement silver spiral earrings that add an avant-garde touch. The long black hair and clean makeup create a modern, editorial look. The photo is shot against a plain background in a classic portrait style, emphasizing the graphic elements of the clothing and accessories. The overall aesthetic blends streetwear, queer fashion, and high-fashion sensibilities in an impactful way.]"
